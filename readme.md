# Visualization of Poncelets's Porism
## Introduction to Poncelets's Porism
In geometry, Poncelet's closure theorem, also known as Poncelet's porism, states that whenever a polygon is inscribed 
in one conic section and circumscribes another one, the polygon must be part of an infinite family of polygons that are 
all inscribed in and circumscribe the same two conics. 
(copied from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poncelet%27s_closure_theorem)

## Goal of the Visualization
In this visualization you can freely select the starting point of a potential polygon on an ellipse check if it
forms a closed polygon. It also displays the functions of Caylyes closure conditions, that allow to find a configuration
with a specific number of vertices.
